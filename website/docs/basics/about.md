sidebar_label: About CashScript
---

CashScript is a high-level programming language for smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash. It offers a strong abstraction layer over Bitcoin Cash' native virtual machine, BCH Script. The CashScript syntax is based on Ethereum's smart contract language Solidity, but its functionality is very different since smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash differ greatly from smart contracts on Ethereum.

CashScript was created in 2019 and has seen major upgrades over the years, including support for the new script functionality enabled with the different Bitcoin Cash network upgrades, including native introspection and CashTokens. Unrelated to the network upgrades, CashScript has also been upgraded with an advanced transaction builder and integrated debug tooling.

CashScript aims to make programming Bitcoin Cash accessible to a wide range of developers and enable the next-generation of UTXO smart contract applications.
