sidebar_label: About CashScript

CashScript is a high-level programming language for smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash. It offers a strong abstraction layer over Bitcoin Cash' native virtual machine, BCH Script. CashScript was created in 2019 and has seen major upgrades over the years, thereby supporting new script functionalities enabled with the different Bitcoin Cash network upgrades â€” including native introspection and CashTokens.

The CashScript syntax is based on Ethereum's smart contract language Solidity, but its functionality is very different since smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash differ greatly from smart contracts on Ethereum. You can read more on these differences on the ['About Bitcoin Cash' page](./about-bch.md).

CashScript comes with a powerful TypeScript SDK for creating, debugging and testing smart contract transactions on BCH. The SDK has an integrated networkProvider API to fetch data from the BCH blockchain. With all this functionality, the Typescript SDK makes it easy to use CashScript contracts in applications in the browser or on the server in a type-safe way.

CashScript aims to make building smart contract apps on Bitcoin Cash accessible to a wide range of developers and to power the next-generation of UTXO smart contract applications.
