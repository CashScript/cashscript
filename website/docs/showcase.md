AnyHedge is the first DeFi project built on top of Bitcoin Cash in the form of a synthetic derivatives platform. AnyHedge allows any two parties to enter into a smart contract together and speculate on the future price of an asset. One of the parties wishes to protect themselves against price fluctuations and takes the *hedge* position, while the other party wishes to speculate and takes a leveraged *long* position.

</div>

Tapswap is the first non-custodial marketplace to trade CashTokens, both fungible token & NFTs, on Bitcoin Cash. Tapswap uses CashScript for its non-custodial token-sale offer contracts. It uses web3 wallet connect feature to allow users to list tokens for sale right from their own wallet.

Bitcats Heroes is the first collectible NFT series on Bitcoin Cash. The project uses CashScript for its non-custodial minting contract. This way the NFT minting guarantees fair access and a transparent NFT launch. The minting page uses a web3 wallet connect feature to allow minting directly from the user's smart contract wallet.

The contract is open source for others to inspect and use the contract code. The Cash-Ninjas minting page uses wallet connect to allow minting directly from the user's smart contract wallet.

## BCH Guru

    <a href="https://bch.guru/" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/bchguru.jpg" /></a>
</div>

BCH Guru is a non-custodial price-prediction platform and a collectible NFT project. BCH Guru uses CashScript for its price-prediction smart contracts to have players commit to a secret price-prediction. The project was the first to pioneer integration with CashConnect, which allows wallets to recognize the smart contract template and understand contract details.

## CashTokens Studio

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://cashtokens.studio" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/cashtokens-studio.png" /></a>
</div>

The CashTokens Studio is an application for creating CashTokens and for their managing metadata updates and reserved supply. The CashTokens Studio uses CashScript to lock the AuthUTXO in an AuthGuard contract to prevent accidentally spending the authority to be able to update the token's metadata or release reserved supply.

## Badgers.cash

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://badgers.cash/" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/badgers.png" /></a>
</div>

BadgerCoin is a fungible CashToken using a novel distibution mechanism. BadgerCoins are earned through staking Bitcoin Cash in the Badgers Smart Contract. The staking duration is predetermined, and depending on the stake amount and period you earn tokens. The website allows for anyone to invoke contract unlocks.

## BCHouse

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>

</div>

BCHouse is a brand new BCH social media site and the first CashTokens-based crowdfunding application on Bitcoin Cash. BCHouse uses CashScript for the crowdfunding smart contract to allow an unlimited number of contributions to a campaign and to enable any BCH wallet to pledge by using forwarding addresses.

## Unspent Phi

    <a href="https://unspent.app/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/unspent_phi.png" /></a>
</div>

Unspent Phi allows users to convert Bitcoin Cash they have today into a series of periodic payments over a long period of time.  It's a set of simple contracts that rely on rolling timelocks and introspection rather than signatures; meaning as long as the correct recipients are paid, anyone may build and submit transactions.
