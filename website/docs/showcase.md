AnyHedge is the first DeFi project built on top of Bitcoin Cash in the form of a synthetic derivatives platform. AnyHedge allows any two parties to enter into a smart contract together and speculate on the future price of an asset. One of the parties wishes to protect themselves against price fluctuations and takes the *hedge* position, while the other party wishes to speculate and takes a leveraged *long* position.

Bitcats Heroes is the first collectible NFT series on Bitcoin Cash. The project uses CashScript for its non-custodial minting contract.

</div>

BCH Guru is a non-custodial price-prediction platform and a collectible NFT project. BCH Guru uses CashScript for its price-prediction smart contracts to have players commit to a secret price-prediction. The project was the first to pioneer integration with CashConnect, which allows wallets to recognize the smart contract template and understand contract details.

## CashTokens Studio

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://cashtokens.studio" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/cashtokens-studio.png" /></a>
</div>

The CashTokens Studio is an application for creating CashTokens and for their managing metadata updates and reserved supply. The CashTokens Studio uses CashScript to lock the AuthUTXO in an AuthGuard contract to prevent accidentally spending the authority to be able to update the token's metadata or release reserved supply.

## Badgers.cash

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://badgers.cash/" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/badgers.png" /></a>
</div>

BadgerCoin is a fungible CashToken using a novel distribution mechanism. BadgerCoins are earned through staking Bitcoin Cash in the Badgers Smart Contract. The staking duration is predetermined, and depending on the stake amount and period you earn tokens. The website allows for anyone to invoke contract unlocks.

## FundMe.cash

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '35%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>

    </a>

FundMe is a new BCH crowdfunding platform using WalletConnect. Fundme campaigns have revocable and refundable pledges through the use of CashTokens receipts. By using receipts, Fundme does not have a maximum limit on the number of participants in a campaign.

## Zapit P2P Exchange

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '50%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://zapit.io/" target="_blank">
        <img src="/img/zapit_logo.svg" style={{width: '100%', margin: "50px 0"}} />
    </a>
</div>

The Zapit wallet has a built-in P2P Exchange which allows user to buy or sell Bitcoin Cash directly without a custodial middleman. The P2P exchange works with an escrow smart contract which is written in CashScript. The P2P exchange contract has already processed hundreds of BCH in volume.

## Unspent Phi

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', width: '50%', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
    <a href="https://unspent.app/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/unspent_phi.png" /></a>
</div>

Unspent Phi allows users to convert Bitcoin Cash they have today into a series of periodic payments over a long period of time.  It's a set of simple contracts that rely on rolling timelocks and introspection rather than signatures; meaning as long as the correct recipients are paid, anyone may build and submit transactions.
