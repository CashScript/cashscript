AnyHedge is the first DeFi project built on top of Bitcoin Cash in the form of a synthetic derivatives platform. AnyHedge allows any two parties to enter into a smart contract together and speculate on the future price of an asset. One of the parties wishes to protect themselves against price fluctuations and takes the *hedge* position, while the other party wishes to speculate and takes a leveraged *long* position.

## Tapswap

</div>

Tapswap is the first non-custodial marketplace to trade CashTokens, both fungible token & NFTs, on Bitcoin Cash. Tapswap uses CashScript for its non-custodial token-sale offer contracts. It uses web3 wallet connect feature to allow users to list tokens for sale right from their own wallet.

## Bitcats Heroes

</div>

Bitcats Heroes is the first collectibele NFT series on Bitcoin Cash. The project uses CashScript for its non-custodial minting contract. This way the NFT minting guarantees fair access and a transparent NFT launch. The minting page uses a web3 wallet connect feature to allow minting directly from the user's smart contract wallet.

## Cash-Ninjas

</div>

Cash-Ninjas is a collectibele NFT project on Bitcoin Cash which focuses on building open-source tooling! The Cash-Ninjas project uses CashScript for its non-custodial, multi-threaded minting contract. The contract is open source for others to inspect and use the contract code. The Cash-Ninjas minting page uses wallet connect to allow minting directly from the user's smart contract wallet.

## BCH Guru

    <a href="https://bch.guru/" target="_blank"><img style={{borderRadius: '100%'}} src="/img/bchguru.jpg" /></a>
</div>

BCH Guru is a non-custodial price-prediction platform and a collectible NFT project. BCH Guru uses CashScript for its price-prediction smart contracts to have players commit to a secret price-prediction. The project was the first to pioneer integration with CashConnect, which allows wallets to recognize the smart contract template and understand contract details.

## Unspent Phi

</div>

Unspent Phi allows users to convert Bitcoin Cash they have today into a series of periodic payments over a long period of time.  It's a set of simple contracts that rely on rolling timelocks and introspection rather than signatures; meaning as long as the correct recipients are paid, anyone may build and submit transactions.
