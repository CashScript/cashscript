title: Contract Instantiation
---

Before interacting with a smart contract on the BCH network, the CashScript SDK needs to instantiate a `Contract` object. This is done by providing the contract's information and constructor arguments. After this instantiation, the CashScript SDK can interact with the BCH contract.

:::info
CashScript offers a TypeScript SDK, which can also be used easily in vanilla JavaScript codebases.
Because of the separation of the compiler and the SDK, CashScript contracts can be integrated into other languages in the future.
:::

## Creating a Contract
The `Contract` class is used to represent a CashScript contract in a JavaScript object. These objects can be used to retrieve information such as the contract's address and balance. They can also be used to interact with the contract by calling the contract's functions.

### Constructor
```ts
new Contract(
  artifact: Artifact,
  constructorArgs: ConstructorArgument[],
  options? : {
    provider: NetworkProvider,
    addressType: 'p2sh20' | 'p2sh32',
  }
)
```

A CashScript contract can be instantiated by providing an `Artifact` object, a list of constructor arguments, and optionally an options object configuring `NetworkProvider` and `addressType`.

An `Artifact` object is the result of compiling a CashScript contract. Compilation can be done using the standalone [`cashc` CLI](/docs/compiler) or programmatically with the `cashc` NPM package (see [CashScript Compiler](/docs/compiler#javascript-compilation)). If compilation is done using the `cashc` CLI with the <span style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}>`--format ts`</span> option, you will get explicit types and type checking for the constructor arguments and function arguments.

The `NetworkProvider` option is used to manage network operations for the CashScript contract. By default, a mainnet `ElectrumNetworkProvider` is used, but the network providers can be configured. See the docs on [NetworkProvider](/docs/sdk/network-provider).

The `addressType` option is used to choose between a `p2sh20` and `p2sh32` address type for the CashScript contract. By default `p2sh32` is used because it has increased cryptographic security â€” but it is not yet supported by all wallets.

:::caution
p2sh32 was introduced because p2sh20 is cryptographically insecure for a large subset of smart contracts. For contracts holding large sums of BCH this provides an incentive to find a hash collision and hack the contract.
:::

#### Example
```ts
import { Contract, ElectrumNetworkProvider } from 'cashscript';
import { compileFile } from 'cashc';

// Import the artifact JSON
import P2PKH from './p2pkh.json' with { type: 'json' };

// Or compile a contract file
const P2PKH = compileFile(new URL('p2pkh.cash', import.meta.url));

const contractArguments = [alicePkh]

const provider = new ElectrumNetworkProvider('chipnet');
const options = { provider, addressType: 'p2sh20' }
const contract = new Contract(P2PKH, contractArguments, options);
```

## Contract Properties

### address
```ts
contract.address: string
```

A contract's regular address (without token-support) can be retrieved through the `address` member field.

:::note
Wallets will not allow you to send CashTokens to this address. For that you must use the [tokenAddress](#tokenAddress) below. Wallets which have not upgraded might not recognize this new address type.
:::

#### Example
```ts
console.log(contract.address)
```

### tokenAddress
```ts
contract.tokenAddress: string
```

A contract's token-supporting address can be retrieved through the `tokenAddress` member field.

#### Example
```ts
console.log(contract.tokenAddress)
```

### opcount
```ts
contract.opcount: number
```

The number of opcodes in the contract's bytecode can be retrieved through the `opcount` member field.

#### Example
```ts
console.log(contract.opcount)
```

### bytesize
```ts
contract.bytesize: number
```

The size of the contract's bytecode in bytes can be retrieved through the `bytesize` member field. This is useful to ensure that the contract is not too big, since Bitcoin Cash smart contracts can be 1,650 bytes at most.

:::info
The size outputs of the `cashc` compiler are based on the bytecode without constructor arguments. This means they will always be an underestimate, as the contract hasn't been initialized with contract arguments.
:::

#### Example
```ts
assert(contract.bytesize <= 1650)
```

### bytecode
```ts
contract.bytecode: string
```

Returns the contract's redeem script encoded as a hex string.

#### Example
```ts
console.log(contract.bytecode)
```

## Contract Methods

### getBalance()
```ts
async contract.getBalance(): Promise<bigint>
```

Returns the total balance of the contract in satoshis. Both confirmed and unconfirmed balance is included in this figure.

#### Example
```ts
const contractBalance = await contract.getBalance()
```

### getUtxos()
```ts
async contract.getUtxos(): Promise<Utxo[]>
```

Returns all UTXOs that can be spent by the contract. Both confirmed and unconfirmed UTXOs are included.

```ts
interface Utxo {
  txid: string;
  vout: number;
  satoshis: bigint;
  token?: TokenDetails;
}
```

#### Example
```ts
const utxos = await contract.getUtxos()
```

### Contract unlockers

```ts
contract.unlock.<functionName>(...args: FunctionArgument[]): Unlocker
```

Once a smart contract has been instantiated, you can invoke a contract function on a smart contract UTXO to use the '[Transaction Builder](/docs/sdk/transaction-builder)' by calling the function name under the `unlock` member field of a contract object.
To call these functions successfully, the provided parameters must match the function signature defined in the CashScript code.

These contract functions return an incomplete `transactionBuilder` object, which needs to be completed by providing outputs of the transaction. For more information see the [transaction-builder](/docs/sdk/transaction-builder) page.

```ts
import { contract, transactionBuilder } from './somewhere.js';

const contractUtxos = await contract.getUtxos();

transactionBuilder.addInput(contractUtxos[0], contract.unlock.spend());
```

:::tip
If the contract artifact is generated using the `cashc` CLI with the `--format ts` option, you will get explicit types and type checking for the function name and arguments.
